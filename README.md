# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

University of Oregon: Data Analytics Boot Camp repository for homework assignment number 11.


## Introduction:

For this assignment I needed to build a web page table from a provided dataset of UFO sightings.  In order to do this, I had to create a function in JavaScript that would read in the data from one file and return it to the web page.  For more detailed explanations of the steps involved, please see the app.js file with my step by step commented code.

### Level 1 Tasks: Completed

1) Create a web page or use the index.html file provided. I chose to use the web page provided in this assignment.

2) Form of an array of JavaScript objects, append a table to the web page and add new rows of data for each sighting.

3) Make columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment that correspond to dataset.

4) Create a search event, that uses the datetime value, to filter the appended sightings table for matches.

5) Publish my web page to GitHub Pages. https://mathewqpmiller.github.io/JavaScript-UFO_Sightings_Publication/

### Level 2 Tasks: Optional

Use multiple input tags, or select dropdowns and write JavaScript code to allow search filters. Create UFO sightings searches using the following criteria based on the table columns:

 1) date/time
 2) city
 3) state
 4) country
 5) shape
