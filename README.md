# JavaScript: UFO Sightings Web Publication

## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation:

For this project I needed to build a web page table from a provided dataset of UFO sightings.  Additionaly, the table needed to be filterable based on certain criteria.  In order to do this I created a function in JavaScript that read in the data from one file and return it to the web page.  I then created an event handler that ran several functions to filter the read in table data.  For more detailed explanations of the steps involved, please see the app.js file with my step by step commented code.

### Level 1 Task: Search by Date

1) Create a web page or use the index.html file provided. I chose to use the web page provided in this assignment.

2) Form of an array of JavaScript objects, append a table to the web page and add new rows of data for each sighting.

3) Make columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment that correspond to dataset.

4) Create a search event, that uses the datetime value, to filter the appended sightings table for matches.

### Level 2 Task: Filter By Value

Use multiple input tags and write JavaScript code to allow search filters. Create UFO sightings searches using the following criteria based on the table columns:

 1) date/time
 2) city
 3) state
 4) country
 5) shape
